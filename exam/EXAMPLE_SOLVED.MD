## Question 1
Who developed the SAMM software assurance methodology?
1. ✅ OWASP
2. BSIMM
3. NIST
4. Microsoft

## Question 2
Language agnostic methods for protecting software systems include secure software design concepts as below.
Match the concept with the (possibly partial) explanation.
1. Least privilege
2. Seperation of duties
3. Economy of mechanism
4. Open design

**A.** 1️⃣ A user or process is given only the minimum level of access rights that is necessary to complete an assigned operation during a minimum amount of time<br/>
**B.** 4️⃣ Unlike security by obscurity, we make implementation details independent from the design<br/>
**C.** 2️⃣ The successful completion of a task should depend on two or more conditions and all need to be met<br/>
**D.** 3️⃣ Keep the software design and the implementation details simple in order to reduce the attack surface of the software

## Question 3
The benefits of designing security early in the SDLC include:
1. ✅ Substantial cost savings
2. ✅ Business logic flows addressed
3. All client requirements satisfied
4. ✅ Resiliant and recoverable software
5. ✅ Minimal re-design needed
6. Testing becomes easy
7. ✅ Quality software with less security errors

## Question 4
What is non-repudiation about?
1. ✅ It prevents deniability of actions
2. It is about the accuracy of the data being transmitted, processed or stored.
3. It is deciding whether the user should be allowed to do some actions.
4. It is about creation, reading, update or deletion actions on an object.

## Question 5
Ssecure applications secure hosts secure networks holistic security expresses the concept that modern software need (order of text)

1. Secure applications
2. Secure hosts
3. Secure networks
4. Holistic security

(4123)<br/>
**Holistic security** express the concept that modern software needs **secure applications** running on **secure hosts** in **secure networks**

## Question 6
What is residual risk about?
1. It is the highest risk that an asset can take
2. It is the risk associated to residual parts of the system
3. It is something that managers should not be concerned about
4. ✅ It is the risk that remains after the implementation of countermeasures and safeguards

## Question 7
Security bugs can be very costly to repair depending on the stage in the software development life cycle in which they are found. In which stage are the costs highest?
1. Requirements engineering
2. Deployment
3. Design
4. Coding
5. Testing
6. ✅ Operations

## Question 8
There are five categories of risk handling methods.
In which category do safeguards and countermesures belong to?
1. ✅ Mitigate the risk
2. Accept the risk
3. Avoid the risk
4. Transfer the risk
5. Ignore the risk

## Question 9
Order the functionality classes in a software assurance methodology such that they match the software development life cycle
<br/><br/>
 1️⃣ Governance<br/>
 2️⃣ Construction<br/>
 3️⃣ Verification<br/>
 4️⃣ Deployment<br/>

## Question 10
### What is the difference between a threat and a vulnerability? 
1. ✅ Vulnerability is a flaw of the system whereas threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability
2. Threat is a potential violation of security which exists when there is a circumstance, a capability or an event that could cause a vulnerability
3. Threat is an expectation of loss expressed as the probability that a particular vulnerability will exploit a system
4. Vulnerability is a design weakness of a system whereas threat is an assault on the system

## Question 11
The following refer to the same Design Principle: Least Privilege and Least Common Mechanism.
1. True
2. ✅ False
